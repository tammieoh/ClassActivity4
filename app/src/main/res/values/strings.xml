    <string name="smug">Smug (Boku, or Kiza) is a personality introduced in New Leaf. They are very polite, kind, and gentleman-like, and will easily get along with other villagers. They seem to be a mix between all personality types and are lively, kind, and positive, but may come off as conceited. In HHD, Smug villagers tend to have a bigger ego and talk about how much they\'re cool most of the time and cooler than everyone else.
        Smug villagers will also occasionally flirt with the player. They wake up at 7AM and sleep at 2AM in New Horizons. So far there have been 35 smug villagers throughout the game, making them the least common male personality. Some villagers in previous Animal Crossing games notably had their personalities changed to smug for New Leaf. The only examples were O\'Hare and Curlos, who both had the cranky personality until New Leaf
        They generally get along with peppy, snooty, normal, lazy and other smug villagers, but may conflict with cranky, jock, and sisterly villagers.</string>
